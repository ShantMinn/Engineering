        <p> 8/25/23 - This week I Learned that working in a team is beneficial, but harder than working by ourselves. From Mr.Pool's first slide I learned about the engineering process and how to correcty use tools. In his second slide I learned how to safely use tools and what equipment I need to wear to stay safe.
            This weekend I am going to go to one of my friends house, who moved. This weekend my little cousins will come over to my house to learn to swim.
