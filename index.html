        <p> <b>8/25/23</b> - This week I Learned that working in a team is beneficial, but harder than working by ourselves. From Mr.Pool's first slide I learned about the engineering process and how to correcty use tools. In his second slide I learned how to safely use tools and what equipment I need to wear to stay safe.
            This weekend I am going to go to one of my friends house, who moved. This weekend my little cousins will come over to my house to learn to swim.

            <b>9/1/23</b> - This week I learned how to CAD a refrigerator with Tinkercad. On Mr. Pool's slide show I leaned that being safe is the number one rule of this class.
        I learned that mechanical engineering is the most used engineering out of all the engineering types. When designing my project on tinkercad, I made a fridge. When our entire classes projects were done a judge voted on whoes project was the best.     <img src="Tinkercad.png" width="180px" height="120px"> </p>
