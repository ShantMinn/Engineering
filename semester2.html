   <b>Jan 15-19 2024</b> - This week I started to work on a project that will last for 6 weeks with my friend Malakai. We have to make a car that is powered by a mouse trap. We also had a challenge day where we had to make a subtance called ooblek which is hard when punched and soft when touched and its made by mixing cornstarch and water together. Joshua no longer sits next to me, now I sit next to Isaac and Malakai.

        <b>Jan 22-26</b> - This week I made a tinkercad with my partner about our mouse trap car. I joined a group with Jack and Isaac to count if there were more doors or wheels. We counted more wheels. Next week I plan on starting to make the car.
