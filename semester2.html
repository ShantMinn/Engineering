   <b>Jan 15-19 2024</b> - This week I started to work on a project that will last for 6 weeks with my friend Malakai. We have to make a car that is powered by a mouse trap. We also had a challenge day where we had to make a subtance called ooblek which is hard when punched and soft when touched and its made by mixing cornstarch and water together. Joshua no longer sits next to me, now I sit next to Isaac and Malakai.

        <b>Jan 22-26</b> - This week I made a tinkercad with my partner about our mouse trap car. I joined a group with Jack and Isaac to count if there were more doors or wheels. We counted more wheels. Next week I plan on starting to make the car.

<p><b>Jan-Feb 29-5</b> - This week I finished my cad and mesurment worksheet. I started on building my car and started to see problems, but we fixed them. This week I am planing to finish the car and start testing it. This weekend I went to a monster truck race I also went to my grandmas house because it was her birthday. By friday I am expecting to finish the car and test it atleast once.

   <p><b>Feb 5-13</b> - This week We almost finished our car. Our car can roll now and all thats left is making a place for the mouse trap. We can make our car better by changing the back wheels that dont roll well. We can also make it better by adding the mouse trap.</p>

   <p><b>Feb 13-26</b> - These 2 week my parter and I finished our car and raced. Our car did not do the best, but it didn't do the worst either. We also got to sabatoge Jack and Isaac. Our car turned to the left and hit their car and stoped it from moving. Our first car went 0 inches, but our second went 26ft. The differnce that changed the distance the car moved was that the wheels on the first bus did not work, but the wheels on the second did. If I were to make a third car, I would change the skewers and the body which were tilted to one side which made it turn when moving.

   <p><b>Feb-March 26-4</b> - this week I was assighned a new project, the egg drop. I have to make something that will make my egg not break when droped from a 2 story building. My groups approach is to make a box with straws and cotton balls surrounding the eggs. We also put balloons on the top of the box to slow the fall. I am scarred that our project will not work and the egg will break which will drop my grade really low. In 2 weeks it is my birthday, Im going to get 2 birthday parrties because my parents are divorced. I also get like 1.5x presents because both sides want to give better presents than the other sides.

   <p><b>March 4-13</b> - these two weeks I have been working on my eggdrop. We made the two boxes with the straws and cotton balls inside, but didnt have a roof for the second box. If we hade more time and more tape we could've made our egg drop better. When we dropped our egg, it fell apart and the egg cracked, but no yolk spilled out. Over spring break I am going to celebrate my birthday and my friend's birthday. mine is on the 18th but I am having my birthday party after my friends birthday which is on the 24th. I am plaing to invite my friends over to my house for a pool party on the 24th because my friend is having his birthday party on the 23rd.

   <p><b>March 13-29</b> - This week I started to make a small boat to float throgh a water pipe. So far we have finnished the Cad and are going to start building the boat for real. My parter for this project is Evan. Our solution is to make a paper boat with a moter and ducttape at the bottom. My favorite part of my spring break was my birthday and my friends birthday. My friends birthday was at a bowling place. My birthday was a pool party the day after my friend's brithday. In school right now I am trying to get an A or B in all my classes.

       <b>March 29-April 8</b> - These past two weeks Evan and I have been working together on a gutter boat project. Originally we were going to use a boat, but later on we switched to a raft because the boat did not work. Our project went 70 cm. Wecould have done better if we didn't wast all of our tape on a moter that we didn't use. My favorite part of this class so far was the Shark tank project becasue it was fun. My least favorite was the mouse trap car because it never worked even after we fixed it until like the 10th try. My plans for this upcoming weekend is that it is my little cousins birthday and my family is going over to my uncles house to celebrate.

<b>April 8-15</b> - last week We were put into groups of 4 for the final project of the boat project. The point of the project is to make a boat that can go from one side of the pool to the other the fastest. Our current plan is to have Evan at the front and Anthoney at the back so the weight is distributed to the back. I am exited to see how our boat will be when we test. last week we compleated a challenge where we made the longest bridge posible with 12 post-it-notes. My partner for the bridge project was Alex. Our project got 9.5 ft which was average for the challenge. I am really excited for summer break to hang out with my friends, even though I will go to summer school.

       <b>April 15-26</b> - These past 2 weeks me, Anthony, and Evan got more cardboard so we could make the walls. So far I have added almost all of the walls only 1 needs to be added. I foresee that our boat might break in half since 2 pieces are put together. I am excited about finishing the boat project and school in the upcoming weeks. The only time I have been stereotyped is when someone had said that when I buy a car it would be a BMW.

       <b> April 29-May 6 </b> - This week started to fix my boat. Evan had broken our boat after we retaped everything. We ran out of tape but Mr. Poole gave us more since our entire boat broke. This week we are going to finish taping and supporting our boat. We are also going to work on the docs that we have been supposed to have been working on throughout the project. I am concerned that we might run out of tape before we finish the boat. Orange Juice is better than apple juice, apple trees are more common than apple trees which means you can ask your neighbors or go into your backyard for oranges but you canâ€™t for apples.
