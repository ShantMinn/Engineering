   <b>Jan 15-19 2024</b> - This week I started to work on a project that will last for 6 weeks with my friend Malakai. We have to make a car that is powered by a mouse trap. We also had a challenge day where we had to make a subtance called ooblek which is hard when punched and soft when touched and its made by mixing cornstarch and water together. Joshua no longer sits next to me, now I sit next to Isaac and Malakai.

        <b>Jan 22-26</b> - This week I made a tinkercad with my partner about our mouse trap car. I joined a group with Jack and Isaac to count if there were more doors or wheels. We counted more wheels. Next week I plan on starting to make the car.

<p><b>Jan-Feb 29-5</b> - This week I finished my cad and mesurment worksheet. I started on building my car and started to see problems, but we fixed them. This week I am planing to finish the car and start testing it. This weekend I went to a monster truck race I also went to my grandmas house because it was her birthday. By friday I am expecting to finish the car and test it atleast once.

   <p><b>Feb 5-13</b> - This week We almost finished our car. Our car can roll now and all thats left is making a place for the mouse trap. We can make our car better by changing the back wheels that dont roll well. We can also make it better by adding the mouse trap.</p>

   <p><b>Feb 13-26</b> - These 2 week my parter and I finished our car and raced. Our car did not do the best, but it didn't do the worst either. We also got to sabatoge Jack and Isaac. Our car turned to the left and hit their car and stoped it from moving. Our first car went 0 inches, but our second went 26ft. The differnce that changed the distance the car moved was that the wheels on the first bus did not work, but the wheels on the second did. If I were to make a third car, I would change the skewers and the body which were tilted to one side which made it turn when moving.
