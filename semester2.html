   <b>Jan 15-19 2024</b> - This week I started to work on a project that will last for 6 weeks with my friend Malakai. We have to make a car that is powered by a mouse trap. We also had a challenge day where we had to make a subtance called ooblek which is hard when punched and soft when touched and its made by mixing cornstarch and water together. Joshua no longer sits next to me, now I sit next to Isaac and Malakai.

        <b>Jan 22-26</b> - This week I made a tinkercad with my partner about our mouse trap car. I joined a group with Jack and Isaac to count if there were more doors or wheels. We counted more wheels. Next week I plan on starting to make the car.

This week I am planing to finish the car and start testing it. This weekend I went to a monster truck race I also went to my grandmas house because it was her birthday. By friday I am expecting to finish the car and test it atleast once.

   <p><b>Feb 5-13</b> - This week We almost finished our car. Our car can roll now and all thats left is making a place for the mouse trap. We can make our car better by changing the back wheels that dont roll well. We can also make it better by adding the mouse trap.</p>
